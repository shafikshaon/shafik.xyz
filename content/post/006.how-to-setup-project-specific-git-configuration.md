Sometimes we need to project-specific git user configurations.

How we achieve this?
Just run the following command in the project directory.

```
git config --local user.name "AuthorName" 
git config --local user.email "AuthorEmail@mail.com" 
```

Now, all commit authors will be new names and emails for the configured project.

That's all!
